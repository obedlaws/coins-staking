# Token Staking or Farm project

In this project i was testing openzeppeling contracts for ERC20 deployment and also created an Staking smart contract to distribute the token instead of selling it into a DEX. The smart contract has all the available token to destribute it to people that wants to stake their tokens into it.


## Tech used
Typescript, Solidity, etherjs, chai(for testing) and hardhat.
